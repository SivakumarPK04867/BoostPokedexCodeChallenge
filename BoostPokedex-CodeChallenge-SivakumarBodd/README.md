Boost Pokedex App
</h1>

## Functionality included in this app:
- Maintain a list of Pokémon. The list may present in a vertical list or grid view form.
  Sort with names or other attributes is a plus.
- Allow user to favourite particular Pokémon and refer it later on Favourite section.
- Allow user to tap on the specific Pokémon to view their abilities in detailed.
- In-memory: Design an in-memory data structure (shared by the same process as
  your application) that will allow you to keep the data in memory without using data
  persistence. It is okay for the data to disappear after the application restarts. You
  may use data structures provided by your language’s standard library to build your
  data structure.
- Tests are an essential part of our software engineering practices here and we’ll like
  you to include them as part of your submission.
- Code comments and documentation: For the key functionalities mentioned above,
  you should provide code comments and text-based documentation (e.g. README)
  on the hows and whys of your implementation and the assumptions you are making.
- If you are using a boilerplate or code scaffolding tools to generate the project, please
  clearly indicate it on your README and indicate via comments / README on the
  parts of the code that were written by you.
- You may consider using any public endpoint or source which you prefer to serve as
  data source.
